# Data Warehousing using SSIS and DAX

This project outlines a structured approach to handling data, covering both its modeling and analytical aspects. 

## Data and full report

The data is from the NorthWind added here as an Excel sheet *' Data_Warehouse_NorthWind'* and all the creation process is detailed in the attached pdf report *'DataWarehouse_SSIS_DAX'*

The task is split into two sections.

- Task 1: Data Modelling and ETL, including table identification, listing relationships, identifying hierarchies, and ensuring the design's future-proofing. 
- Task 2: Data Analysis, use of DAX formulae to provide answers to specific questions utilizing pivot tables
